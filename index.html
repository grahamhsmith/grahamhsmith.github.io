        across Target's entire chain of 1800+ stores. I oversaw this business through the tumultuous 2020 
        and 2021 sales seasons.</li>
      <li>Developed an Excel tool to more accurately and nimbly update sales forecasts for items at a regional

        partnerships with name-brand vendors and own-brand manufacturers. Implemented JIT inventory strategy, 
        while taking sales & presentation needs, and global supply chain conditions into consideration.</li>
      <li>Executed time-sensitive projects like pushing inventory downstream from warehouses, and 
        expediting product in response to supply-chain delays</li>
